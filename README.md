# PredictOMatic

This is the first version of the predict_o_matic web-application. The current version is private.<br>
Predict-o-matic is a project which tries to generate predictions for the crypto currency market. These predictions are made using well known machine learning self-optimizing algorithms.
The project is made for fun and is in no way intended to provide actual trading advice.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
